This is a placeholder file to verify the public directory is working correctly.

To fix the background image:
1. Save the gorilla image you provided as "gorilla-backdrop.jpg" (or .png)
2. Place it directly in the "public" folder (not in an images subfolder)
3. The image path should be: C:\Users\pcwor\Downloads\x1\justagorilla\public\gorilla-backdrop.jpg

Alternatively, you can update the path in the Hero component if you prefer a different location.
